Few Natural Language Processing projects 

In this Natural Language Processing projects I worked on couple of projects which can accomplish three kinds tasks

1. Predict the text of a test data based on the data I trained it with
 - Predict 10 words of taylor swift song lyrics
 - Predict famous starwars quote which is trained on 2000+ sentences taken from Irish poems
 
 2. Sentiment Analysis
  - Analyze sentiment on the reviews of IMDB movies
  - Analyze the pet adoption descriptions given in petfinder.my website
  
 3. Classify the headlines from a popular newspaper to see there is any sarcasm present.
